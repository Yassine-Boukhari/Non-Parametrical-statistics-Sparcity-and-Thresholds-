# Non-Parametrical-statistics-Sparcity-and-Thresholds-
## The Goal of this project in the first part was to apply various methods based on studying sparcity with threshold using hard, soft and non-negative-garotte threshold, followed by studying change detection theory and then ponctuated by a case study on a real dataset around tire deterioration from UCI Machine Learning Database.
